# The Caverns (WIP)

_"oooo mario's tunnel-of-a-doom. very scery." -mario_

Deep underground lies a dark and spacious cavern. It's quite an interesting sight to see! There are a couple major regions, like a Nether-like region, as well as a frozen cavern.

## Accessing the cavern region

The caves are accessed by tunneling below about **-y50**, at that point you should 'feel' the transition. You'll know it when you get there! Once you're in the cave region, you'll find that everywhere is still deepslate; to get to the actual caverns, go down to **\~y270**. Remember, _don't dig straight down_!

## Mining

The caverns provide you will a resource that every player cherishes: **diamonds**! If you haven't noticed, no ores are generated in the map, rather, as you mine, you will find '[hidden veins](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]' of ore that will show themselves randomly as you tunnel. Diamonds are _only_ found in the caves; you don't need to be in the caverns, just within the cave region.&#x20;

## Biomes/Regions

Something else you may have tried was building a nether portal and finding it doesn't work. Turns out, the Nether has migrated to the caverns! There are currently 3 (?) biomes in the caverns: forest, 'nether,' and frozen (?). You can find each by exploring, but the largest region is covered by forest.

_going to make a seperate section for each biome and their features_

### Forest





[^1]: Hidden veins will do 1 of 2 things:

    * Randomly replace the surrounding stone with a couple ores.
    * Give you some common materials (sand, copper ore, gravel, etc.)
