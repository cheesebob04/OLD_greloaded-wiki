# Classes, skills, and attributes

_"The first step to becoming stronger is finding out you had 7 unspent points that you could've used on hyper-buffing that attack stat." -cheese_

When you first join, you'll start with:

```
1 Class point
3 Skill points
1 Skill reallocation point
3 Attribute points
1 Attribute reallocation point
```

But what do all these points do? Let's find out!



## Classes & Sub-classes

One of the first things you should do is pick your class! Each class has different stats, and will gain increased bonuses in certain areas upon leveling up. After reaching level 10, you will have access to sub-classes! Think of it like an upgrade to your original class, where you branch to different stylized versions of the original.

Pick one by talking to the Class Master!

_Picking a class will consume one class point._ \
_'Upgrading' to a sub-class will consume one class point._

## Skills

Skills are different for each class! For most classes, you will only be able to access skills at a certain level later on. Run `/skills` to see if you have any available skills. Players who don't have available skills at the start, check back at level 10!&#x20;

Skills are special moves that you can do. You can cast them using Mana, a regenerating resource that will vary in speed and capacity depending on your class.&#x20;

_thats all i know i havent got a class with skills yet lmao_



## Attributes

Your player has 3 core attributes: <mark style="color:orange;">Strength</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">Dexterity</mark>, and <mark style="color:blue;">Intelligence</mark>. Each attribute will has give certain statistics, which will increase on level up. Each attribute can have a maximum of 40 attribute points invested in them.

_Increasing the level of an attribute will consume one attribute point._
