Artists work mainly on the resourcepack, in many different ways. We use Discord to collaborate on the resourcepack, so anyone can help out without requesting anything from us.\

There are also pages in Notion to keep track of weapons or creatures in [here](https://www.notion.so/gensokyorealoaded/afc6a9450ab048debb45474e0819e138?v=19d48d004b8e49f19553356274f49e91)(items) and [here](https://www.notion.so/gensokyorealoaded/0f4aa9d48f3e45e5b61e2b49f9f504e2?v=64296c0854104e15b819c6a51687a8ba)(mobs)

### Recommended Blockbench Plugins:

* **Brush Color Randomizer:** If you are doing your textures in blockbench this will help with giving materials a variation and depth.
* **Optimize:** This will help with clearing the unused block faces for better performance to players.
* **Brush Plus:** This will add custom bursh feature as well as cutomization to brushes.

## Roles
